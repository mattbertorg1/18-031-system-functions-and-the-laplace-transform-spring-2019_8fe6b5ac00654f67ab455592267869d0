This half-semester course studies basic continuous control theory as well as representation of functions in the complex frequency domain. It covers generalized functions, unit impulse response, and convolution. Also covered are the Laplace transform, system (or transfer) functions, and the pole diagram. Examples from mechanical and electrical engineering are provided.
