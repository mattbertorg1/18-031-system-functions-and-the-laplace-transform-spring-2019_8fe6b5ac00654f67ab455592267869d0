Student Insights
----------------

_Below, student Madeleine Schroeder reflects on her experiences in the course_.

I am a first-year student and I plan to major in aerospace and astronautics. I decided to take this course because I was only taking four courses when the second half of the semester began and I wanted a little extra work to do. I have enjoyed _[18.03 Differential Equations](/courses/18-03sc-differential-equations-fall-2011/)_ this semester and I thought it would be interesting to learn other methods of solving ODEs \[ordinary differential equations\] that have more accessible uses in engineering.

{{< quote "Reading the lecture notes outside of class allowed me to work at my own pace." "— Madeleine Schroeder" >}}

I liked the course format as it allowed a lot of freedom in studying. Reading the lecture notes outside of class allowed me to work at my own pace, slowing down when I got confused and speeding up if I understood the material well. Having two hours of class as recitation was very helpful, as I was able to practice problem-solving methods with help present and work through concepts that I didn’t understand from the lecture notes.

My advice to other students is to take advantage of the flexibility of the course and the opportunity to work on learning material on your own. My advice to instructors is to provide more practice problems with solutions provided. These would be incredibly helpful in completing problem sets.
